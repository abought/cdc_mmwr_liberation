* Case counts for reporting years 2011 and 2012 are provisional and subject to change.
For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf.

† Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks 
following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years.  The total sum of incident cases is then 
divided by 25 weeks. Additional information is available at
