-: No reported cases
N: Not notifiable
Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.

* Incidence data for reporting years 2008 and 2009 are provisional, whereas data for 
2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 are finalized.

† Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks 
following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years.  Additional information is available at 
http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf.

§ Not notifiable in all states.  Data from states where the condition is not notifiable are excluded from this table, 
except starting in 2007 for the Arboviral diseases and influenza-associated pediatic mortality, and in 2003 for 
SARS-CoV.  Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/SRCA_FINAL_REPORT_2006-2010.xlsx.

¶ Includes both neuroinvasive and non-neuroinvasive. Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious 
Diseases, National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance). Data for 
West Nile virus are available in Table II.

** The names of the reporting categories changed in 2008 as a result of revisions to the case definitions. Cases 
reported prior to 2008 were reported in the categories: Ehrlichiosis, human monocytic (analogous to E. chaffeensis); 
Ehrlichiosis, human granulocytic (analogous to Anaplasma phagocytophilum), and Ehrlichiosis, unspecified, or other agent 
(which included cases unable to be clearly placed in other categories, as well as possible cases of E. ewingii). 

†† Data for H. influenzae (all ages, all serotypes) are available in Table II.

§§ Updated monthly from reports to the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, 
Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Implementation of HIV reporting influences the 
number of cases reported. Updates of pediatric HIV data have been temporarily suspended until upgrading 
of the national HIV/ AIDS surveillance data management system is completed. Data for HIV/AIDS usually are 
available quarterly in Table IV.

¶¶ Updated weekly from reports to the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory 
Diseases. Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.

*** Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.

††† Data for meningococcal disease (all serogroups) are available in Table II.

§§§ In 2008, Q fever acute and chronic reporting categories were recognized as a result of revisions 
to the Q fever case definition. Prior to that time, case counts were not differentiated with respect 
to acute and chronic Q fever cases.

¶¶¶ Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.

**** Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, National Center for Zoonotic, 
Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases.
