-: No reported cases
N: Not reportable
NN: Not Nationally Notifiable
Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.

* Case counts for reporting year 2010 are provisional and subject to change.
For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf.

† Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks 
following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years.  The total sum of incident cases is then 
divided by 25 weeks. Additional information is available at 
http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf.

§ Not reportable in all states.   Data from states where the condition is not reportable are 
excluded from this table except starting in 2007 for the Arboviral diseases, STD data, 
TB data, and influenza-associated pediatric mortality, and in 2003 for SARS-CoV.   Reporting 
exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/SRCA_FINAL_REPORT_2006-2010.xlsx.

¶ Includes both neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive. Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious 
Diseases, National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance). Data for 
West Nile virus are available in Table II.

** Data for H. influenzae (all ages, all serotypes) are available in Table II.

†† Updated monthly from reports to the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, 
Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Implementation of HIV reporting influences the 
number of cases reported. Updates of pediatric HIV data have been temporarily suspended until upgrading 
of the national HIV/ AIDS surveillance data management system is completed. Data for HIV/AIDS, 
when available, are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly.

§§ Updated weekly from reports to the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory 
Diseases. Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.

§§§ In 2009, Q fever acute and chronic reporting categories were recognized as a result of revisions 
to the Q fever case definition. Prior to that time, case counts were not differentiated with respect 
to acute and chronic Q fever cases.

¶¶¶ Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.

**** Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, National Center 
for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases.
