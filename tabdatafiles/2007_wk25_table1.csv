-: No reported cases
N: Not notifiable
Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.

* Incidence data for reporting years 2006 and 2007 are provisional, whereas data for 
2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 are finalized.

† Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks 
following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years.  Additional information is available at 
http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf.

§ Not notifiable in all states.  Data from states where the condition is not notifiable are excluded from this table, 
except starting in 2007 for the Arboviral diseases and influenza-associated pediatic mortality, and in 2003 for 
SARS-CoV.  Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/SRCA_FINAL_REPORT_2006-2010.xlsx.

¶ Includes both neuroinvasive and non-neuroinvasive. Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious 
Diseases, National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance). Data for 
West Nile virus are available in Table II.

** Data for H. influenzae (all ages, all serotypes) are available in Table II.

†† Updated monthly from reports to the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, 
Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Implementation of HIV reporting influences the 
number of cases reported. Updates of pediatric HIV data have been temporarily suspended until upgrading 
of the national HIV/ AIDS surveillance data management system is completed. Data for HIV/AIDS usually are 
available quarterly in Table IV.

§§ Updated weekly from reports to the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory 
Diseases. Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.
