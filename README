This repository contains scripts to scrape data from the CDC's MMWR (Morbidity
and Mortality Weekly Report), and write it into an easily accessible database. 

The initial commit represents work performed over a 36-hour period at the 2013 Ann Arbor
Hack for Change event. Be sure to check for hard-coded file paths when running these scripts, as
some scripts assume that files will be in specific places not reflected by the directory
structure shown in the repository.
