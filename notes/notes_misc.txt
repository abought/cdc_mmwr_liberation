Here are some sample table headers/descriptions and misc notes to help figure out which tables are the same or different.
The headers can be mass-examined using the unix command:
head -2 *table2A*
or similar



Table 1:
TABLE I.  Provisional cases of infrequently reported notifiable diseases (<1,000 cases reported during the
preceding year), United States, week ending March 2, 2013 (WEEK 09)


TABLE II. (Part 8)  Provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases, United States,
week ending March 3, 2007 (WEEK 09)*

TABLE IV.  Provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases, United States,  quarter ending December 30, 2006 (52 WEEK)



THE CDC CAN'T SPELL- and hasn't proofread in years!
Such as table 2H (some data moved to 2J ~2008 or 2009)
"Syphillis, primary & secondary cummulative for 2007"
Possible that's just an issue with the web formatter script, not the print tables?

Also: special, weird footnote characters make sense in print. But in a tab-separated values file, there must be a
way that doesn't kick up so many programmer-unfriendly encoding errors. One tableset (2007 wk 13) doesn't even
download via the bulk script- consistently kicks back HTTPError 500: internal server error.
It seems to hang the CDC script on the server too when I tried to read the HTML version via the website.
